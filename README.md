# scholarcrawler

Absolutely simplistic scraper for extracting search hits from Google Scholar.

Limitations:
- fixed formatting (to be pimped up)
- no proxy/IP rotating or cookie management, and as a consequence, Google responds with a 429 and filters the requests from the IP for a day (to be pimped up with CookieJar or similar)
